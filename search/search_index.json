View as a PDF here </p> <p>CropScout is a rugged, weather-resistant rover built to help monitor crops and assess field conditions. It gathers data on crops and their environment using a multi-purpose probe mounted on a movable front arm. This probe measures ambient temperature, humidity, and soil pH, with pH readings taken using a glass electrode and a custom analog signal-conditioning circuit.</p> <p>An onboard camera allows CropScout to visually inspect crops, identify produce, and record field conditions as it moves through the field. The rover runs on a rechargeable battery and uses large rubber wheels, making it well-suited for uneven or soft agricultural terrain.</p> <p>To help farm workers quickly identify problem areas, CropScout features a stake-dispensing mechanism that marks locations where potential crop issues are detected. These stakes can be deployed automatically based on sensor readings or manually through the user interface.</p> <p>CropScout wirelessly connects to a user application that provides real-time access to crop and environmental data, captured images, and battery status. The application records inspection results, including the number of detected issues and their reason codes, so farm workers can review them later.</p> <p>For on-site operation, CropScout features a local interface with pushbuttons and an OLED display. This interface allows users to view sensor readings, receive alerts when issues are detected, and manually control rover movement and system functions while in the field.</p> <p>These functions are arranged in the following subsystems for development:</p> <ul> <li>Land Marker- Stake Dispenser (Actuator) </li> <li>Large Rubber Wheels (Actuator)</li> <li>Front Arm (Actuator)</li> <li>Temperature Probe (Sensor)</li> <li>Humidity Probe (Sensor)</li> <li>pH Probe (Sensor)</li> <li>Controller ( Human Machine Interface)</li> <li>Communication Module (Two-way wireless communication)</li> </ul> <p>CropScout is built to be intuitive and easy to use, featuring clear icons, remote error alerts, and task-focused controls for quick, simple operation in the field.

Since the goal of CropScout is to explore agricultural fields without requiring the user to walk through them, basic mobility is essential. Forward and backward motion allows the rover to navigate rows, while turning enables it to avoid obstacles and reposition itself. This requirement supports all other system functions by allowing the rover to reach areas of interest.</p> </li> <li> <p>TR-02:   CropScout is intended to operate in outdoor field environments where access to wall power is not available. Because of this, the system must run entirely on battery power for a reasonable amount of time. Establishing a minimum runtime ensures the rover can complete basic tasks, while a longer target runtime improves usability. This requirement also places constraints on subsystem power consumption and overall system design.</p> </li> <li> <p>TR-03:   Measuring soil or environmental humidity allows the rover to provide useful information related to crop and soil conditions. At a minimum, the rover should be able to distinguish between wet and dry conditions, which can help identify irrigation issues. Higher resolution measurements allow for more detailed analysis and better decision-making. This requirement supports CropScout\u2019s role as a monitoring and inspection tool.</p> </li> <li> <p>TR-04:   A human-machine interface is required so the user can control the rover and interact with its data. At a minimum, physical buttons allow basic control of movement and system functions. Adding a display improves usability by providing feedback such as sensor readings, system status, and error messages. This requirement ensures the rover can be operated intuitively without relying on autonomous behavior.</p> </li> <li> <p>TR-05:   Ambient temperature is an important environmental parameter that can affect crop health and growing conditions. This requirement ensures the rover can measure temperature with reasonable accuracy instead of relying on estimates. Improving accuracy in the target measurement allows for more reliable data collection. Temperature data also complements other sensor readings to provide a more complete picture of field conditions.</p> </li> <li> <p>TR-06:   CropScout must be able to send sensor data to the controller while also receiving control commands from the user. This two-way communication allows the user to both monitor the environment and actively control the rover\u2019s behavior. Low latency ensures that the rover responds quickly to user inputs and that sensor data appears in real time. This requirement is critical for smooth operation and user confidence in the system.</p> </li> <li> <p>TR-07:   Because CropScout is made up of multiple modular subsystems, all boards must communicate using the same communication lines. At a minimum, one-way messaging allows basic data transfer between subsystems. Two-way UART communication enables more advanced interactions, such as acknowledgments and status reporting. This requirement ensures the system functions as a unified device rather than a collection of independent boards.</p> </li> <li> <p>TR-08:   The front arm subsystem interacts directly with the environment, which introduces the risk of damaging probes or mechanical components. This requirement ensures that the system can detect excessive pressure and respond safely. When unsafe conditions are detected, the arm must stop and return to a safe position. Error reporting helps inform the user of what occurred and prevents repeated damage.</p> </li> <li> <p>TR-09:   Subsystem error reporting improves system reliability and helps users understand what is happening during operation. At a minimum, alive signals indicate that subsystems are still functioning. More detailed error messages allow users to identify specific problems and take corrective action. This requirement supports easier debugging and a better overall user experience.</p> </li> <li> <p>TR-10:   A clear startup and initialization process is necessary to ensure all subsystems are ready before operation begins. This requirement ensures that basic communication is established as soon as the system powers on. Reporting readiness to the HMI within a defined time gives the user confidence that the rover is functioning properly. This also helps prevent commands from being sent before the system is fully initialized.</p> </li> <li> <p>TR-11:   Deploying physical markers allows users to identify locations of interest directly in the field. This requirement supports practical workflows such as marking areas that require follow-up inspection or maintenance. Using the front arm subsystem allows markers to be placed accurately and deliberately. Supporting multiple marker types provides additional flexibility for representing different observations.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"04-Team-Block-Diagram/Team-Diagram/","title":"Block Diagram, Protocol, and Message Structure","text":""},{"location":"04-Team-Block-Diagram/Team-Diagram/#header","title":"Header","text":"<p>Add content!</p>"},{"location":"Appendix/appendix/","title":"Appendix","text":""},{"location":"Appendix/appendix/#appendix-content","title":"Appendix Content","text":"<ul> <li>Appendix - Extra Team Organization Information</li> </ul> <p>add to list.</p>"},{"location":"Appendix/01-Organization-Information/Append-Organization/","title":"Appendix - Extra Team Organization Information","text":""},{"location":"Appendix/01-Organization-Information/Append-Organization/#roles-responsibilities","title":"Roles &amp; Responsibilities","text":"<p>Table 1: Project Roles and Duties</p> Role Duties Meeting leader - Jacob Alger Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting Meeting recorder - Caleb Yuen Takes minutes of each team meeting, including attendance, and records action items and to whom they are assigned Assignment leader - Cristopher Gutierrez Coordinates the team's work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date Project monitor - Aaron Kiem Tracks the team's progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status Team Regulator #1 - Isaiah Johnston Assists team member's and facilates team responsibilities Team Regulator #2 - Asadbek Ruziev Assists team member's with meeting engineering requirements and facilates team responsibilities"},{"location":"Appendix/01-Organization-Information/Append-Organization/#frequency-of-role-changes","title":"Frequency of role changes","text":"<ul> <li>Project roles will be updated as the project progresses and reviewed during weekly team meetings.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Appendix/01-Organization-Information/Append-Organization/#role-assignment-decisions","title":"Role assignment decisions","text":"<ul> <li>Role adjustments will be decided collectively, with each member acknowledging their responsibilities before proceeding. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Appendix/01-Organization-Information/Append-Organization/#team-support-and-collaboration","title":"Team support and collaboration","text":"<ul> <li>Team members will work interdependently and communicate early if help is needed to allow the team to coordinate support.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Appendix/01-Organization-Information/Append-Organization/#adjusting-roles-and-responsibilities","title":"Adjusting roles and responsibilities","text":"<ul> <li>Members will communicate any issues affecting their work in advance, either during weekly meetings or through urgent communication (text/call).
