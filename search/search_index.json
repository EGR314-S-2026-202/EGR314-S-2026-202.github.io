The device allows an operator to move through fields from a distance while receiving real-time sensor feedback about the surrounding area. Instead of operating autonomously, the system keeps a person fully in control of all movement and actions, allowing the operator to make decisions based on live data and visual information. The device acts as an inspection and exploration tool that helps identify anomalies, obstacles, or irregular field conditions while demonstrating how embedded sensing, actuation, communication, and user interface subsystems work together in a practical application.</p>"},{"location":"02-Concept-Design/Design/#audience","title":"Audience","text":"<p>The primary audience for this device is farmers and farm managers who need efficient ways to monitor crops and field conditions without manually walking large areas of land. By using a remotely operated exploration device, operators can inspect fields, check for damage, and identify potential issues while saving time and reducing physical labor. A secondary audience includes agricultural technology developers and researchers who are interested in testing remote control systems, sensor integration, and human-machine interfaces for precision agriculture. For these users, the device serves as a flexible and low-cost platform for experimenting with agricultural monitoring technologies.</p>"},{"location":"02-Concept-Design/Design/#exploration-device-100-ideas-brainstorming","title":"Exploration Device \u2013 100 Ideas (Brainstorming)","text":"<p>Below is our initial brainstorming spreadsheet that lists potential features, sensors, mobility options, and system concepts considered for our exploration device.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"02-Concept-Design/Design/#sort-rank-and-group","title":"Sort, Rank, and Group","text":""},{"location":"02-Concept-Design/Design/#product-concept-designs","title":"Product Concept Designs","text":"<p>Animated exploration rover concept by Aaron Kiem</p>"},{"location":"02-Concept-Design/Design/#selected-concept","title":"Selected Concept","text":"<p>(With a header, create a section that is a short summary of the decision-making process your team used to pick one of the team's design concepts and a image that shows this concept.
