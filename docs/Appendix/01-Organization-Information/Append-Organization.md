* Phone calls serve as the secondary communication method when immediate clarification or discussion is needed.
* Email is used as the tertiary communication method, primarily for formal communication, documentation, and instructor correspondence.

**Response Expectations**
* Team members are expected to respond to **text messages within 12 hours.
* Phone calls should be returned within 24 hours if missed.
* Emails should be responded to within 48 hours unless otherwise specified.

**Escalation Procedure**
* If no response is received via text within the expected timeframe, communication may be escalated to a phone call.
* If further documentation or formal follow-up is required, email will be used.
    
 **Team Accountability**

* Consistent communication is expected to ensure alignment with project milestones and deadlines.
