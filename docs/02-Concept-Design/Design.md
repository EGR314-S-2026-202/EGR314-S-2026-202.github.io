## Goal

The goal of our exploration device is to create a human-controlled, remote-operated ground robot designed for use in agricultural environments. The device allows an operator to move through fields from a distance while receiving real-time sensor feedback about the surrounding area. Instead of operating autonomously, the system keeps a person fully in control of all movement and actions, allowing the operator to make decisions based on live data and visual information. The device acts as an inspection and exploration tool that helps identify anomalies, obstacles, or irregular field conditions while demonstrating how embedded sensing, actuation, communication, and user interface subsystems work together in a practical application.

## Audience

The primary audience for this device is farmers and farm managers who need efficient ways to monitor crops and field conditions without manually walking large areas of land. By using a remotely operated exploration device, operators can inspect fields, check for damage, and identify potential issues while saving time and reducing physical labor. A secondary audience includes agricultural technology developers and researchers who are interested in testing remote control systems, sensor integration, and human-machine interfaces for precision agriculture. For these users, the device serves as a flexible and low-cost platform for experimenting with agricultural monitoring technologies.
