## Team Charter

> S.C.O.U.T.S is a group that focuses on communication, responsibility, and efficiency. We want to work together to make a high-quality product that we can all be proud of.

To create this Charter, the team sat down and discussed each individula's top 3 goals and qualities they want to achive and demontrate. Characterizing the Charter in this group setting ensured that we all agreed on the Charter's content and the team's goals moving forward.

## Product Mission Statement

> S.C.O.U.T.S mission is to develop a modular exploration device that enables remote users to safely and expeditiously observe and interact with challenging environments through integrated sensing, actuation, and wireless communication.

To create this Mission Statement, we held a meeting to discuss the product's description and how we planned to achieve a successful outcome. We then boiled these ideas down to a single statement that accurately captures our desires for this product.
