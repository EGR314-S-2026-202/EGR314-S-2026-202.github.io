## Team Charter

> Team 202 is a group that focuses on communication, responsibility, and efficiency. We want to work together to make a high-quality project that we can all be proud of the end result once we are finished.

To create this Team Charter, we all sat down and discussed our top 3 goals for this team and the qualities we want in our team. Deciding the Charter in this group setting ensured that we all agreed on the Charter's content and the team's goals moving forward.

## Product Mission Statement

> Team 202’s mission is to develop a modular exploration device that enables remote users to safely observe and interact with challenging environments through integrated sensing, actuation, and wireless communication.

To create this Mission Statement, we held a meeting to discuss the project's description and how we planned to achieve a successful outcome. We then boiled these ideas down to a single statement that accurately captures our desires for this product.
